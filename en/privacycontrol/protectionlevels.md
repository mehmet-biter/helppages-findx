# Protection levels in Findx Privacy Control

The Findx Privacy Control provides three levels of control over your privacy. When you install the extension in your browser, you will be asked to choose a level.

**For children**: This is the strongest level of protection where personalised advertising is blocked, the stronger protection lists are used, adult content will have a warning displayed, and unnecessary cookies are auto-deleted after each browsing session. 

**Standard**: Acceptable ads are allowed so you can support your favourite sites, the popular protection lists are used which include protection against malicious sites and trackers, [social tracking](/en/privacycontrol/socialtracking) is disabled so that Facebook can't build a profile about you even when you are not a member.

**Custom**: For when you want full control. You can choose which protection lists you want to use, disable cross-site tracking, get [detailed control over the cookies](/en/privacycontrol/managecookies) stored on your device.

Every protection level can use the built in private search feature and instant answer tools. 

You can change your protection level at any time, in the [Privacy Control Settings](/en/privacycontrol/settings).
