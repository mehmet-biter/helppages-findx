# Manage cookies

Cookies are small files that are stored on your device when you visit a website. Some are functional, like those that let you log into a site or add items to your shopping basket.
Some help website providers know which content visitors like the most, or which products are most popular. 

But many cookies can be invasive and track you across all the websites you visit, noting what you buy, when and from where, what places you are interested in visiting and more. With Findx Privacy Control, third-party cookies - those that track you across sites - are blocked by default. 

It's annoying to individually manage your cookies in your browser. The Findx Privacy Control browser extension makes it easy. You can quickly whitelist or blacklist entire sites or specific cookie 'providers'.

## See the cookies stored by a website

1. Go to a website, click on the Findx Privacy Control icon, then click the Cookies tab if it's not displayed.
2. The yellow summary shows you the number of cookies saved and blocked, and you can quickly whitelist (allow), blacklist (block) or delete (trash icon).
3. To see a list of the cookies, click **Cookies from this website**
4. Next to an individual cookie, click the three vertical dots to see the full details.

**Tip**: If a site tries to set cookie that has been blacklisted, it will be displayed in this list in red text, and it will not be saved to your computer.

### See the details of an individual cookie 

* Name: The name of the cookie.
* Content: What the cookie contains.
* Host: Where the cookie has been sent from. First-party cookies are hosted on the site that you visit, whereas third-party (tracking or advertising) cookies will have a different URL than the site you are looking at. 
* Path: Normally a "/", but some cookies may be set when you visit a sub-section of a site, for example: "/blog".
* Send for: This tells the browser when to send the cookie back to the web server. 
* Expires: When the cookie will be either automatically deleted by your browser, or replaced with a new valid cookie the next time you visit the site. 

If a cookie is on a whitelist, the **WHITELIST** link will be grey. If it's on a blacklist, the **BLACKLIST** link will be grey.

## Whitelist or blacklist cookies

You can block (blacklist) or allow (whitelist) cookies in several different ways. 

### Allow or block **all** cookies from a site

1. Go to the website then go to the Cookies tab in the Findx Privacy Control extension.
2. In the yellow summary at the top of the tab, click **WHITELIST** or **BLACKLIST**.

### Allow or block an individual cookie

1. Go to the website then go to the Cookies tab in the Findx Privacy Control extension.
2. Click **Cookies from this website** to see the list of all cookies, then click the three vertical dots to see the details of one particular cookie. 
3. Click **WHITELIST** or **BLACKLIST**. 

## See all domains that have set cookies

You can see all of the websites that have saved a cookie to your device.

1. Go to the Cookies tab in the Findx Privacy Control extension.
2. Click **Sites with cookies set**. 

You can whitelist or blacklist entire domains from this list and stop them from storing cookies on your device.

* Click the three vertical dots next to a site's name and then click **Whitelist domain** or **Blacklist domain**. 

Whitelisted domains are green and blacklisted domains are red.

**Note:** If an individual cookie has been whitelisted or blacklisted, this takes a higher precedence than domain whitelisting/blacklisting. For example, if you have blacklisted one cookie from a site, then whitelist its domain, that individual blacklited cookie will stay blacklisted.

## Block or allow third-party cookies

1. Go to the Cookies tab in the Findx Privacy Control extension.
2. Click the **Prevent cross-site tracking** toggle button to block (green) or allow (grey) third-party cookies. 

## Autodelete unwanted cookies

Some cookies are automatically deleted every time you close your browser with Findx Privacy Control to make sure your privacy is protected. But you can choose not to autodelete cookies easily. 

1. Go to the Cookies tab in the Findx Privacy Control extension. 
2. Click the **Autodelete unwanted cookies** toggle button. Grey means that cookies are autodeleted, and green means they will be saved. 

## Manage your whitelisted and blacklisted sites

1. Go to the Cookies tab in the Findx Privacy Control extension. 
2. Click on **Cookie control**.
3. To manage the sites that are allowed to save cookies, click on **Whitelisted sites**. To manage your blocked sites, click on **Blacklisted sites**.
4. You can remove a site from the whitelist or blacklist by clicking the large **X** next to the site's name.
