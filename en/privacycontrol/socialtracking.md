# Stop social tracking

Facebook and Google can track you as you browse around the web, even if you don't have an account. That's because many website owners put tracking scripts on their pages. We are sure you seen those Facebook 'like' buttons, or Google's 'plus' button, and similar social buttons with tracking on the websites you visit - those are what we call social tracking.

With Findx Privacy Control, you can easily turn these off. 

1. Click on the Findx Privacy Control icon.
2. Under the **Protection** tab, there is a section for the two most popular social trackers.  Click on the slider toggles to disable these social media trackers (they'll turn red). 

To be doubly protected, you can also stop social sites from setting third-party cookies. 

1. Click on the Findx Privacy Control icon. 
2. Under the **Cookies** tab, click on the **Prevent cross-site tracking** toggle button so that it is green.
