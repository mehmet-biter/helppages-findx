# Manage my whitelist

You can tell the Findx Privacy Control browser extension that certain page elements are always ok - to allow and display them whenever they appear on a web page. 

The whitelist uses uBlock Origin directives.

1. Click on the Findx Privacy Control icon.
2. Click on the gear icon at the top right.
3. Click the My Whitelist tab.
4. Enter the directives in the large text box, one directive per line. If a directive is invalid, it will simply be ignored - your browser will still function as normal. 
5. Click *Apply changes* to save your whitelist.
