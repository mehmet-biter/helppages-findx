You can choose how Findx Privacy Control manages cookies in general via the advanced settings. 

Go to the settings and options page:
1. Click on the Findx Privacy Control icon.
2. Click on the gear icon at the top right.

On the Settings tab, towards the bottom, there are four options for handling cookies: 

* Clear domain cookies on tab close: This will delete any cookies that a site has set when you close the tab or the browser (enabled by default).
* Block third-party cookies: This stops third-parties (advertisers and social media platforms) from being able to track you across sites (enabled by default). 
* Periodically clear cookies every xxx minutes: You can choose to delete stored cookies after a set amount of time: Enter the number of minutes, and enable this checkbox. 
* Clear cookies on browser start: This will delete stored cookies when you open your browser, including expired cookies that are often not deleted by browsers by default.
