# Control your privacy

By using the Findx Privacy Control browser extension, you can control who has access to your personal information when you browse the web and the cookies that are stored on your computer.

It can be a bit technically complex to know what should be blocked and what is ok, even with cookies. So, we've made it easy. 

By default, the Findx Privacy Control browser extension uses established blocking lists to block malware, third-party and advertising trackers - anything that contacts a third-party website.

Of course, you don't want to block everything - cookies can make it easier to use a website - for example, to remember your login information, or what is in your shopping basket. This information stays between you and the website you are visiting, so it's usually ok!

## How does it work?

The Findx Privacy Control provides three levels of control over your privacy. When you install the extension in your browser, you will be asked to choose a level.

- **For children**: This is the strongest level of protection which blocks advertisements, trackers, and malicious and adult content. 
- **Standard**: This is a good level of protection for every-day use - acceptable ads are allowed, invasive tracking scripts and malicious contentare blocked.
- **Custom**: You have complete control over everything - choose the protection lists you prefer, allow or disallow trackers and cookies individually.

You can [subscribe to additional protection lists or create your own custom protection list](/en/privacycontrol/manageprotectionlists) in the Findx Privacy Control settings. 

You have [complete control over the cookies](/en/privacycontrol/managecookies) that are allowed to be stored on your device.

If you are using the Standard or Custom levels, you can also easily [block social tracking](/en/privacycontrol/socialtracking) - little trackers that webmasters put on their pages to let users 'like' the page. These little trackers collect your personal information, even if you don't have an account with that social media provider!
