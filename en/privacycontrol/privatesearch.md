## Use the instant answers

Speed up your searching with our popular [instant answer tools](/en/instantanswers). 

Go to the search tab in Findx Privacy Control and enter your search term in the search field. Instead of pressing enter or clicking on the magnifying glass you can see the following answers instantly: 

* **[Weather forecast](/en/instantanswers/weather)** - works best when you have entered a location!
* **[Timer](/en/instantanswers/timer)** - set a timer to give you a visual alarm in your browser. Click the play button to start your timer.
* **[Calculator](/en/instantanswers/calculator)** - see a calculator to the right of your search results on Findx. 

Of course, you can click on each of these tools without entering a search query to jump directly to Findx.

## Search for locations, videos and images

Quickly search for specific information - you can open a [map](/en/maps) at a specific location, or see the [videos](/en/features/video) or [images](/en/features/images) that match your search query.

Go to the search tab in Findx Privacy Control, and enter your search term in the search field. Click **Maps**, **Videos** or **Images** to be redirected to the more specific Findx search.
